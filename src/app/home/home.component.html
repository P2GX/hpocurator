<h1>HPO Curator</h1>
<p>This application is intended to support biocuration of GA4GH Phenopackets. For each disease to be curated, users should read or create an Excel curation template file. Use the x window to curate cohorts (from tabular data), and use the mining window to perform text mining on individual cases.</p>
