HPO Curator is a tauri application with a Rust backend and an Angular front end.

The application makes major use of the following rust crates.

- [ontololius](https://docs.rs/ontolius/latest/ontolius/){:target="\_blank"}
- [rphetools](https://github.com/P2GX/rphetools){:target="\_blank"}
- [rfenominal](https://github.com/P2GX/rfenominal){:target="\_blank"}


This page summarizes some of the angular and Rust/tauri commands that have been useful to create the application.


## Initial setup
These steps were used to initialize the application and do not need to be repeated
```bash 
npm create tauri@latest
```
The installer will ask questions about settings. We chose typescript, angular, npm.

Following this, run the following command.

```bash 
npm install
```

Note that we are using **standalone** components.

## Run the GUI application in development mode
```bash 
npm run tauri dev
```



### Creating new components
The standard command for creating a new component called ``<name>`` is
```bash 
ng generate component <name> --standalone
```
You need to run the Angular CLI command from the root of your Angular project â€” the directory that contains the angular.json file.
To create a component in a specific path, enter:
```bash 
ng generate component components/hpoloader --standalone --skip-import
```
Note that this may not work after updating to nx. In this case, create a directory where you want to put the new component, cd into the directory, and
enter this
```bash 
npx nx generate @nx/angular:component hpoloader --standalone
```
This will initialize the typical four files for an angular component.

### Added routing
```bash
ng add @angular/router
```

### Angular material
To install
```bash
npm install @angular/material
```
